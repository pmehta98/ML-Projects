# 🏥 Insurance Claim Prediction Project

## 📌 Business Question
**"How can an insurance company predict the claim amount for individuals based on demographic and health factors to better assess risks and optimize pricing strategies?"**

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
This project aims to develop a **predictive model** that estimates insurance claim amounts using **demographic and health-related data**. The insights from this model help insurance companies:

- **Optimize Pricing**: Set fair and competitive premiums.
- **Assess Risk**: Identify high-risk customers effectively.
- **Enhance Profitability**: Reduce miscalculations in claims, ensuring operational efficiency.

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters
1. **Relevance**: Accurate claim predictions help insurers maintain profitability while offering fair pricing.
2. **Impact**: Improved risk assessment ensures customer satisfaction by aligning premiums with actual risk profiles.
3. **Business Optimization**: Better resource allocation and fraud detection through data-driven insights.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes key features related to policyholders' **demographics, health conditions, and insurance history**.

### **🔑 Key Features Considered**
- **Demographics:** Age, gender, income, region.
- **Health Indicators:** BMI, smoking status, medical history.
- **Policy Information:** Insurance type, claim history, deductible.
- **Target Variable:** `Claim Amount` - the total amount claimed by a policyholder.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
- **Handled missing values** using appropriate imputation techniques.
- **Engineered new features** like `age category`, `BMI range`, and `risk score`.
- **Encoded categorical variables** using one-hot and label encoding.
- **Normalized numerical features** to improve model performance.

### **2️⃣ Model Selection & Training**
- **Explored multiple machine learning models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
- **Hyperparameter tuning** was applied using **grid search and cross-validation**.
- **Feature importance analysis** was conducted using **SHAP values and permutation importance**.

### **3️⃣ Model Evaluation**
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Root Mean Squared Error (**RMSE**)
  - Mean Absolute Error (**MAE**)
  - R² Score (**R-squared**)
- **Baseline models** were compared to determine the best-performing approach.

## 📈 Results & Insights
- **Top predictors** of insurance claim amounts include **age, BMI, smoking status, and past medical expenses**.
- **Tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) outperformed linear models**, providing better accuracy in predicting claim amounts.
- **Feature engineering significantly improved model performance**, emphasizing the importance of domain-specific insights.

# 🏡 Airbnb Booking Demand Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Predicting **Airbnb booking demand** is crucial for **hosts, property managers, and platform optimization**. This project aims to **forecast the number of days a listing will be booked in the next 30 days** using **machine learning models** trained on real Airbnb data from Los Angeles. 

By leveraging **listing attributes, host information, availability trends, and seasonality**, this model helps hosts make **data-driven pricing and availability decisions** while improving overall demand forecasting.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of **real Airbnb listings** from Los Angeles, including details such as **price, location, availability history, and host attributes**.

### **🔑 Key Features Used**
- **Listing Attributes:** Price, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, accommodates, property type, etc.
- **Host Information:** Superhost status, number of reviews, response time, etc.
- **Geographical Data:** Neighborhood, latitude, longitude.
- **Availability Trends:** `availability_30` and historical booking patterns.
- **Seasonality Factors:** Day of the week, holidays, and event-based demand fluctuations.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
- **Handled missing values** using median/mean imputation.
- **Created new features**, including:
  - `price_per_person`
  - `booking_ratio` (availability vs. total possible bookings)
  - One-hot encoding for categorical variables.
  - Temporal indicators for seasonality trends.
  
### **2️⃣ Model Selection & Training**
- **Evaluated multiple machine learning models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - LightGBM
- **Used cross-validation** for hyperparameter tuning and model selection.
- **Final model selection** was based on **R² score and feature importance analysis**.

### **3️⃣ Feature Importance Analysis**
- Applied **SHAP values** and **permutation importance** to identify key features.
- **Top Influential Factors**:
  - **Price**
  - **Location (Neighborhood & Latitude/Longitude)**
  - **Availability trends**
  - **Host credibility metrics**

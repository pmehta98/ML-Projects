## 📁 Projects

### 🏡 **1. Airbnb Booking Prediction**
- **Folder:** [`Airbnb Booking Prediction`](./Airbnb%20Booking%20Prediction)
- **Objective:** Predict the number of days an Airbnb listing will be booked in the next 30 days.
- **Techniques Used:** Feature engineering, tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM), cross-validation.
- **Key Insights:** Pricing, location, and host credibility significantly impact booking demand.

### 📰 **2. Fake News Classification**
- **Folder:** [`Fake News Classification`](./Fake%20News%20Classification)
- **Objective:** Classify news articles as **real** or **fake** using deep learning techniques.
- **Techniques Used:** Pre-trained transformer models (`sentence_transformers`, `HuggingFace transformers`).
- **Key Insights:** Fine-tuned transformer models significantly outperform traditional ML approaches.

### 🏥 **3. Insurance Claims**
- **Folder:** [`Insurance Claims`](./Insurance%20Claims)
- **Objective:** Predict the insurance claim amount based on demographic and health factors.
- **Techniques Used:** Regression models (Linear Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest), feature engineering, risk assessment modeling.
- **Key Insights:** Age, BMI, smoking status, and past medical expenses are strong predictors of claim amounts.
